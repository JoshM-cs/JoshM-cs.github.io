### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I thought it was really cool how we were able to create a guessing game where the user could interact with the computer and try to guess  the secret number. Creating this game was very fun because I used do-while loops for the first time in order to calculate the player's guess and decide if it was too hot or cold. 


* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was very cool because we got to create code that calulated the area of a rectangle. This was our first lab using unittest and I really enjoyed having our code in different files because it made it less stressful. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was very nice because we used ifstream to read the contents of an animation file so that the animation could playback smoothly. What was funny about this lab was that we only had 43 lines of code with a few if statements yet it took us so long to complete it. I liked this lab because we got to play the animation and use ifstream to open it.
